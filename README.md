# Yawn-Detection

This application is built using a Python frontend (built using Streamlit) and a Flask backend.
The Flask backend is an API which accepts an image and uses a Deep Learning Model trained on 2000+ images to determine the probability of whether a person is yawning or not.
This information is then displayed using the frontend.
